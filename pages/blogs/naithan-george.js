        Floor General Needed: Naithan George&apos;s Fit with the Cuse
      </h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Brian Papiernik • June 2025</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Syracuse didn&apos;t need more talent this offseason – they needed direction. What the Orange lacked was a true point guard who could organize the offense, distribute the ball, and cut down on turnovers. With dynamic wings like Kiyan Anthony and Sadiq White Jr. joining the fold, proven shooters like Nate Kingz, and returning five-star scorer JJ Starling, the roster is rich in offensive tools. In order to unlock it all, they need a steady hand at the helm who can elevate others and keep the offense flowing. 
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        That&apos;s where Naithan George enters the picture. The Georgia Tech transfer isn&apos;t the flashiest name in the portal, but he might be one of the most important additions in the ACC this offseason. George brings structure, ball movement, and a sense of control to a team that&apos;s been missing a true floor general last year.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">What George Did Well at Georgia Tech</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        George logged nearly 88% of the available minutes for Georgia Tech last season which shows how much the coaching staff trusted him to run the show. He posted a 34.6% assist rate while maintaining a 22.6% usage rate without forcing shots. While he didn&apos;t light it up as an efficient score, he made everything easier for his teammates when on the court compared to off the court.

        When George was on the court, Georgia Tech&apos;s offense was more efficient, more connected, and more dangerous around the rim. His ability to find cutters or shooters out of the pick-and-roll gave the Yellow Jackets a level of organization that disappeared when he sat. Even though the rim rate dropped slightly with him on the floor — from 48.0% to 38.7% — the efficiency at the rim increased significantly. This indicates he wasn&apos;t just getting his team to the rim more often, he was helping them get better looks when they got there.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Georgia Tech&apos;s Offensive Style</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Georgia Tech wasn&apos;t overwhelming from a talent standpoint, but their offense had a distinct identity. They emphasized spacing, pick-and-roll reads, and creating high-quality looks at the rim or from three. Unlike Syracuse, they avoided inefficient midrange shots It was a system that prioritized decision-making and floor balance, and George thrived in it.

        Transition and Pick-and-Roll: Where George Adds Value
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
        Two areas where George thrives are in transition and the pick-and-roll. He doesn&apos;t force tempo for the sake of pace. However, he reads the floor well and creates efficient scoring chances when the opportunity to push tempo is there. Also, George has comfort in high pick-and-roll usage systems especially in the ACC.

        <p className="mb-4">
        Georgia Tech ran pick-and-rolls in high volume, even if their efficiency didn&apos;t match the volume. This shows that George is well-versed in reading pick-and-roll coverages, navigating the screens, and delivering in tight windows. George has the chance to turn these reps into better results with Syracuse&apos;s better finishers and 3-point spacers.  
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
        His impact in transition can also be important.  Syracuse ranked near the bottom nationally in transition PPP, while George&apos;s team ranks in the top 80. His ability to push off rebounds, hit advancing guards, or create secondary breaks adds an important dynamic Syracuse sorely lacked.

        <p className="mb-4">
        Syracuse&apos;s shot profile showed heavy reliance on midrange, a lack of clean catch-and-shoot threes, and a lower rim-and-3 shot diet than George&apos;s former team. Their 14.5% catch-and-shoot 3PT frequency ranked 316th nationally. They produced just 0.90 points per possession on these opportunities.

        It&apos;s easy to see George&apos;s value by comparing him to Syracuse&apos;s 2024 backcourt options. While JJ Starling and Jaquan Carlos each brought something to the table, neither offered the complete package as a lead point guard. Carlos had vision but struggled with turnovers. Starling was miscast as a primary ball handler. George solves both problems by organizing the offense, limiting mistakes, and allowing Starling to thrive off-ball as a slasher and scorer.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Better Spacing with Kingz on the Wing</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
        Perhaps the biggest reason to believe in a leap from George at Syracuse is the upgraded perimeter spacing. The Orange struggled to generate and hit threes last year, but that changed with the addition of Nate Kingz from Oregon State.

        <p className="mb-4">
        Kingz is an elite shooter — both in terms of volume and efficiency. He gives George a spacing outlet on the wing that opens up driving lanes and makes pick-and-roll reads more dangerous. With Kingz spotting up and Starling or the freshmen wings cutting, George will have more high-value options on every possession than he did at Georgia Tech.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Final Thoughts: The Quiet Catalyst</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
        Naithan George may not be a headline-grabber, but his impact will be felt in every Syracuse possession. He doesn&apos;t need to score 20 points a night to change the way this team functions. George just needs to keep the offense flowing. He&apos;s the kind of player that makes everyone else&apos;s job easier. With George running the show, Syracuse finally has a conductor.
