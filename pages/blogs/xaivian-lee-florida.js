        When Walter Clayton Jr. moved on from Florida after winning the National Championship, the Gators lost one of the most efficient shot-makers in the SEC and the entire country. However, Florida did not panic in finding a replacement to one of their key pieces. Florida may have found a player who doesn&apos;t replicate Clayton&apos;s production exactly but potentially enhances their overall offense in different ways through versatility, rim pressure, and creation. Florida&apos;s replacement is Princeton transfer Xaivian Lee who has a radically different but highly complementary skillset when compared to Clayton.

      <p className="mb-4">
        This breakdown explores what Lee brings to the table for the Gators, how he functioned in Princeton&apos;s system, how Florida&apos;s system with Clayton differs, and how Lee&apos;s skills fill the Gators&apos; gaps heading into 2025-26.

        Xaivian Lee&apos;s impact goes beyond the traditional scoring. When he&apos;s on the floor, Princeton not only takes more shots at the rim and shares the ball better – they also shoot 2.1% better from the three-point line On the other end of the court, opponents shoot 3.7% worse from deep which suggests that Lee&apos;s perimeter defender has potential to limit clean perimeter looks. Even if Lee isn’t known as a defensive stopper, Princeton’s three-point defense improved with Lee on the court which points to value as a good communicator and help defender for Florida.

        Lee didn&apos;t just generate high-quality possession – he converts them at a slightly-better than expected rate with a Shot Making value of +0.05. That&apos;s an encouraging statistic for a high-usage guard who can create his own looks in addition to creating good looks for his teammates. Lee&apos;s 88.5% Rim + 3 Rate highlight that he consistently took efficient shots, and his Good Possession Rate (22.8%) confirms that he makes the most out of those chances. Additionally, Lee adds 5.4 assists per game which shows he can function as both a creator and playmaker. Lee did a great job of keeping Princeton&apos;s offense efficient and balanced.

        Princeton relied on guard-heavy creation by using pick-and-rolls, spacing the floor, and transition to generate good looks. They were able to create highly efficient possession through IQ and ball movement despite not having elite athleticism and length. Lee was the centerpiece of this offense by initiating ball screens and pushing tempo to create scoring opportunities. The high efficiency in transition and off-the-dribble shots shows his versatility and comfort in operating both on the fastbreak and in the halfcourt.

        Florida was a below-average pick-and-roll and off-the-dribble efficiency team. This was mainly because Walter Clayton was more of a shot-maker than greater initiator especially in the pick-and-roll setting. On the other end, Lee thrives in structured P&R sets where he can read coverages and make the right decision. This can be very beneficial especially with multiple quality Florida frontcourt. His elite transition efficiency will also be a boost to Florida&apos;s tempo-based attack. With his Rim + 3 Rate at 88.5%, he fits their offensive philosophy perfectly by prioritizing clean looks at high-value locations on the floor.

        In summary, Clayton was a pure scorer – an elite shooter who consistently hit tough shots both on-and-off the dribble. Lee won&apos;t fill that exact void, but he offers an important role: making the offense easier for everyone else. His ability to create advantages early in possession through penetration and passing gives Florida more ball movement and more flow. Even though he won&apos;t match Clayton&apos;s shooting, he offers value in a different, connective way.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Xaivian Lee gives Florida something it lacked:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>A true pick-and-roll creator</li>
            <li>An initiator who can create advantages without isolating</li>
            <li>A playmaker who fits the team&apos;s rim-and-three shot philosophy</li>
            <li>A lead guard who can make others better — especially in transition and high ball screens</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
        Lee isn&apos;t being brought in to replicate Walter Clayton&apos;s production — he&apos;s being brought in to change how that production happens. Think of it like Moneyball: the Gators aren&apos;t replacing Clayton with one-for-one scoring — they&apos;re replacing him in the aggregate. By leaning into Lee&apos;s strengths — ball screen creation, rim pressure, and connective passing — Florida may not only match the statistical output but unlock more layers in their offense. If the system embraces Lee&apos;s playmaking and pace, they may not just fill a hole — they may build something more dynamic around it.
