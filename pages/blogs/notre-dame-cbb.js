      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Overview</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Notre Dame played one of the slowest paces in the country last season under Micah Shrewsberry, ranking bottom 10 nationally in transition frequency and relying heavily on pick-and-roll creation. The offense revolved around Markus Burton&apos;s downhill play and spot-up shooting from Braeden Shrewsberry and Cole Certa. Notre Dame also ranked top-50 nationally in P&R frequency and showed improved spacing as the season progressed. In Year 2, with more athleticism from Jalen Haralson and a deeper rotation, expect the Irish to build on that foundation. They&apos;ll still play methodically, but better off-ball movement and cutting should create more efficient half-court looks. The loss of Matt Allocco&apos;s steady presence may slightly impact ball security, but the increased talent infusion adds offensive versatility.
        </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Transfers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Carson Towt:</strong>Carson Towt brings a versatile, high-IQ frontcourt presence to Notre Dame after an impactful season at Northern Arizona. His on-off splits tell the story of a player who helps do the little things — when Towt was on the floor, his team posted a +7.7 net rating compared to -2.6 when he sat. Offensively, Towt&apos;s presence coincided with improved efficiency inside the arc — the team shot 61.4% at the rim with him on versus 54.2% off — while maintaining strong ball movement (54.0% assist rate on vs. 46.9% off) and better shot quality overall (52.5% eFG% on vs. 50.8% off). His combination of interior finishing, passing vision, and offensive rebounding (32.9% ORB% on-court) made him a reliable hub in the half court. Defensively, they allowed 4.7 fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the court, held opponents to a lower free throw rate (30.6% on vs. 38.9% off), and defended shots more effectively across the board.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At Notre Dame, Towt projects as a point forward who will orchestrate offense with his passing while bolstering the Irish&apos;s team rebounding. His Torvik numbers back up that role — posting an elite 19.0% assist rate for a frontcourt player, a 32.1% defensive rebounding rate, and converting 63.0% of his close twos. He adds efficient scoring touch (56.4% eFG, 53.9% TS) with the ability to finish through contact (41.3% FTr, .852 FT%). His passing and offensive rebounding should directly aid Notre Dame in two key areas from last season — cutting and finishing at the rim — where the Irish averaged 1.09 PPP on cuts (229th nationally) and 1.09 PPP at the rim despite ranking just 290th in rim attempt frequency. By creating more high-quality looks through quick interior feeds and second-chance opportunities, Towt can help lift both the volume and efficiency of these high-value shots.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Returning Starters</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Markus Burton:</strong>As a sophomore in 2024–25, Markus Burton once again carried the offensive load for Notre Dame, serving as the team&apos;s lone reliable shot creator. He posted a massive 33.4% usage rate and was involved in nearly every halfcourt possession, using his burst and shiftiness to generate rim pressure and collapse defenses. Despite facing constant attention, he made significant efficiency gains from his freshman year, improving his offensive rating to 107.4 and shooting 37.5% from three and 84.8% from the line. He drew contact at a high rate (31.4 FTR), finished well around the rim (46.9% on 2P), and remained the team&apos;s lead playmaker with a 22.2% assist rate. However, the team&apos;s 3-point shooting still dipped slightly with Burton on the floor (34.7% vs. 36.7%), reflecting the cost of limited spacing when defenses collapsed on his drives and dared others to beat them from the perimeter.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Micah Shrewsberry&apos;s offense revolved around patient tempo, structured spacing, and heavy pick-and-roll initiation — but without consistent shooting or a true secondary ball handler, the system placed too much on Burton&apos;s shoulders. The arrival of five-star freshman Jalen Haralson, a versatile 6&apos;6” point-forward, offers hope for a more balanced attack. Haralson&apos;s size and passing vision could allow Burton to play off the ball more often, using his quickness to cut, spot up, or attack closeouts — potentially unlocking even greater efficiency. Burton&apos;s defensive impact was modest but steady, and he still made plays in passing lanes with a strong 3.1% steal rate. His relentless motor and ability to generate offense from scratch remain the heartbeat of Notre Dame&apos;s identity.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Braeden Shrewsberry:</strong>Braeden Shrewsberry brings reliable floor spacing to Notre Dame&apos;s offense, serving as a pure shooting threat who primarily operates off-ball. His on-off splits show the Irish were significantly better from beyond the arc with him on the floor (37.0% vs. 31.9%), and their spacing improved noticeably with his presence. However, his defensive impact was a concern — the team allowed 110.4 points per 100 possessions when he played compared to just 102.4 when he sat. Rim defense also suffered with him on the court (67.3% FG% allowed at the rim vs. 61.0% off), suggesting struggles with closeouts and help-side containment. Despite this, his shooting gravity opened up lanes for drivers like Markus Burton and helped raise the offense&apos;s ceiling in the halfcourt.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Under Micah Shrewsberry, Notre Dame&apos;s offensive system emphasized deliberate tempo, heavy pick-and-roll usage, and creating shots off ball movement and screening actions. Offensively, Shrewsberry&apos;s role was that of a high-volume catch-and-shoot option aaaa (36.9%), thriving on flare screens and spot-up looks. He posted a 52.9% eFG and 54.9% TS rate, but his low assist rate (9.6%) and limited rim pressure meant he operated mostly as a play-finisher rather than a creator. Notre Dame played one of the slowest paces in the country and often relied on spacing the floor with multiple shooters to complement Burton&apos;s drives. Defensively, they were less switchable on the perimeter, and Braeden&apos;s below-average steal and block rates (1.0 STL%, 0.5 BLK%) highlight his limitations as a defensive playmaker. To become a more complete contributor, growth in team defense and lateral agility will be key in Year 3.

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Kebba Njie:</strong>Kebba Njie served as Notre Dame&apos;s primary interior presence during the 2024–25 season, anchoring the frontcourt with efficient finishing and quietly stabilizing the defense. The 6&apos;10” junior posted a 58.2% effective field goal percentage and a 60.9% true shooting mark, converting 70.0% of his 2-point attempts. Offensively, Njie was a low-usage play-finisher (15.4% usage) who thrived on dump-offs, rolls, and second-chance points (11.2% OReb%). While not a playmaker (3.6% assist rate), he helped raise Notre Dame&apos;s offensive efficiency to 110.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor, compared to just 104.6 when he sat. His screen-setting and rim gravity complemented Markus Burton&apos;s slashing and created cleaner finishing opportunities in the halfcourt. Njie also drew fouls at a solid clip (44.5 FTR) and shot 70.2% from the line.

      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Defensively, Njie&apos;s on-off splits show a clear positive impact. The Irish allowed just 105.5 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor, compared to 110.2 when he was off — a +10.9 net rating swing. Opponents were actually more efficient from beyond the arc with him on the court (34.1% vs. 29.9%), but his interior deterrence made a difference: rim attempts dropped from 37.3% to 30.9% when Njie played. He also helped reduce fouling (24.1 dFTrate vs. 37.0 off) and stabilized the glass, boosting Notre Dame&apos;s defensive rebounding percentage from 70.4% to 77.2%. While his 2.9% block rate wasn&apos;t elite, it reflected consistent vertical contests, and his positional discipline helped limit breakdowns in the paint. Njie may not have posted flashy defensive numbers, but his presence quietly improved Notre Dame&apos;s team defense across multiple areas.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Returning Bench Options</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Cole Certa:</strong>Cole Certa didn&apos;t see significant minutes until the latter portion of the 2024–25 season, but he flashed real value as a floor-spacer and movement shooter in Notre Dame&apos;s system. The freshman guard finished with a modest statistical line (10.7% Min%, 42.5 eFG%), but his on-off data highlights how his presence helped boost the Irish offense. With Certa on the floor, Notre Dame&apos;s 3-point attempt rate jumped from 36.6% to 45.3%, a reflection of how his off-ball gravity and quick trigger altered the team&apos;s shot distribution. Lineups featuring Certa scored 108.7 points per 100 possessions and held opponents to just 103.0, resulting in a +5.7 net rating — a significant improvement over the team&apos;s -0.4 mark when he was off.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Certa&apos;s skillset aligned well with Notre Dame&apos;s slow-paced, spacing-focused offense, which frequently relied on spot-up and off-screen actions. His shot profile (36 of 40 total FGA from three) underscores his role as a specialist, and he converted 91.7% of his free throws, hinting at untapped scoring upside. While his individual defensive metrics weren&apos;t standout, the team&apos;s rim rate dropped slightly (from 34.8% to 33.5%) and their defensive foul rate didn&apos;t spike with him on the court, indicating solid positional awareness. As a sophomore, Certa will look to expand his role, but his ability to space the floor is already a valuable asset in Shrewsberry&apos;s system.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Sir Mohammed:</strong>Sir Mohammed showed flashes of promise as a versatile freshman wing, but his impact was mixed across both ends of the floor. While his overall efficiency remained a work in progress (41.4 eFG%, 41.5 TS%), his strength and length gave him a physical edge on drives and post-ups. He finished 65.2% of his close 2s and 51.1% of his 2-point shots overall, hinting at solid touch around the rim. Despite his offensive rating sitting at 84.6, Mohammed&apos;s willingness to attack gaps gave Notre Dame a different dynamic from the wing — especially in a system heavy on halfcourt sets and off-ball actions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The on-off numbers tell a complicated story. With Mohammed on the floor, Notre Dame&apos;s offensive rating dropped significantly (96.9 vs. 111.1), and the team posted a -12.7 net rating. Opponents also shot better from deep (33.7% vs. 31.6%) and finished more efficiently at the rim (62.0% vs. 66.1%). However, Notre Dame&apos;s own rim rate dipped with him on, and he drew fouls at a strong clip (31.0 FTrate), demonstrating a level of aggressiveness and physicality. Defensively, his steal (2.6%) and block (1.2%) rates were decent for a freshman, and he showed flashes of disruption in help-side situations. As he develops more consistency with his jumper (5-for-29 from three) and tightens his decision-making (23.8 TOV%), Mohammed could emerge as a key two-way contributor in Year 2.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Garrett Sundra:</strong>Garrett Sundra offered glimpses of floor-spacing potential as a freshman stretch big. Despite a limited offensive role (12.7% usage), he posted an efficient 124.1 offensive rating while shooting 67.6% true shooting and 64.5% eFG. He knocked down 8 of 20 threes (40.0%) and finished well around the rim (7-for-9 on close 2s), showing good touch in limited attempts. His presence bumped the team&apos;s 3P rate to 43.0% during his on-court minutes (up from 36.6%), giving Notre Dame much-needed spacing in a system that otherwise skewed inside-focused The Irish used him primarily in halfcourt sets and pick-and-pop scenarios, and his smart positioning helped open driving lanes and trigger inside-out action.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Irish&apos;s offensive rating with Sundra on the court (105.6) wasn&apos;t far off the team average, but they struggled more on the defensive end (109.4 DRTG) and on the glass. Notre Dame&apos;s overall rebounding took a hit when he played — both offensive rebounding (26.3% ORB% vs. 30.2%) and defensive rebounding (62.6% DRB% vs. 75.9%) dipped noticeably, limiting second-chance opportunities and allowing more for opponents. Still, opponents shot worse from deep when he was on (27.1% dTP%) and his block rate (1.8%) showed some rim deterrence in a help role. He also took care of the ball (19.8 TOV%) and provided smart floor spacing, fitting cleanly into off-ball actions and pick-and-pop sets. If he continues to grow as a team defender and rebounder, Sundra could become a rotation-caliber stretch big in Year 2.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">HS Recruits</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Jalen Haralson:</strong>Haralson arrives at Notre Dame as a versatile, lengthy wing capable of operating as an oversized point guard. His presence should help alleviate the ball-handling load on Markus Burton, allowing Burton to play more off-ball and attack in scoring situations. Haralson is a confident ball handler who excels in pick-and-roll play, where he can both create his own shot and serve as a good passer to set up teammates — a key need for the Irish after ranking 137th nationally at 0.99 PPP in that category last season. He is equally effective in isolation, where Notre Dame also struggled (110th nationally at 0.91 PPP), using his length, handle, and footwork to create separation and score against a variety of defenders.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Offensively, Haralson can create his own shot and is a strong rim attacker, while also showing improvement as an outside shooter to keep defenses honest. He draws fouls at a solid rate and converts consistently from the free throw line. Under Micah Shrewsberry, he has the potential to operate in “booty-ball” fashion similar to Jalen Pickett at Penn State, playmaking out of post-up situations by backing down defenders and making smart reads. His drive-and-kick ability fits seamlessly into Notre Dame&apos;s offense, and his willingness to play within the system makes him an ideal complementary piece to Burton in the backcourt. On the defensive end, Haralson&apos;s length gives him the versatility to guard multiple positions, contest shots effectively, and disrupt passing lanes, adding value on both ends of the floor.
