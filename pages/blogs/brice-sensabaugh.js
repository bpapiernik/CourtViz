        Brice Sensabaugh: Hidden Gem?
      </h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Brian Papiernik • June 2025</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When the Utah Jazz selected Brice Sensabaugh with the 28th pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, many were betting on a high-upside scorer with questionable defense due to his bulky frame. Sensagbaugh brings an unusual mix of length, strength, and scoring touch as a forward standing at 6&apos; 5” with a 6&apos; 11” wingspan. Fast forwarding to the 2024–25 season, Sensabaugh is quietly building a compelling statistical case for a larger role with the Utah Jazz.

        Elite Efficiency in Scoring Roles
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Sensabaugh&apos;s offensive profile is unique when looking at his Synergy playtype data:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Pick-and-Roll Man:</strong> Sensabaugh is 99th percentile in effectiveness – scoring 1.62 points per possession. While its unusual for a forward of his size to rank this highly, this shows Sensabaugh&apos;s ability to make quick reads and smart decisions in short-rolls or slip actions. A big reason for this success is his soft floater touch, which consistently punishes when defenders collapse on the ball-handler.

        </li>
         <li>
          <strong>Transition (89th percentile)</strong> and <strong>Spot-Up Shooting (67th percentile):</strong>{" "}
          Sensabaugh thrives in both fast-paced and half-court catch-and-shoot scenarios by posting a solid 1.33 PPP in transition and 1.10 on spot-ups. This showcases his ability to do damage in multiple offensive scenarios.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Catch and Shoot:</strong> Across the board, Sensabaugh ranks 90th+ percentile in volume and efficiency. His catch-and-shoot ability might be his most translatable offensive skill at the NBA level, as his elite 0.65 effective field goal percentage (eFG%) places him among the league&apos;s most efficient spot-up shooters. This is an impressive trait especially at the age of 21 in his 2nd year.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        These metrics confirm what the shot chart shows — he&apos;s shooting well from above the break and the wings.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
        Pull-Up Ability: Another Unique Layer to His Game
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        While catch-and-shoot remains his special skill, Sensabaugh&apos;s pull-up game has developed nicely. Sensabaugh ranks in the 80th+ percentile across pull-up FGM, 3PM, and total points among the forward position. Additionally, Sensabaugh shoots pull-up 3-point shots at a respectable 36% clip. His ability to create and hit shots off the bounce can open up the offense when the shot clock is running down.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
        Driving Game with some Limitations
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Sensabaugh ranks in the <strong>75th percentile</strong> in driving volume among forwards, scoring <strong>2.2 points per game on 3.7 drives</strong>. However, his passing metrics on drives remain concerning:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Assist % on Drives:</strong> 36th percentile</li>
        <li><strong>Pass % on Drives:</strong> 53rd percentile</li>
        <li><strong>Turnover %:</strong> 16th percentile</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        He is turning over the ball a lot on drives without creating much for others either. This makes him more of a decisive scorer than a playmaker when he attacks off the dribble.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
        Passing Profile: Average, Not Flashy
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In traditional passing metrics, Sensabaugh is average to slightly below average among forwards:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Assist to Pass %:</strong> 84th percentile — when he does pass, it&apos;s productive</li>
        <li><strong>Adjusted Assists and Assist Points Created:</strong> hovering around the 60–66th percentile range</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        He doesn&apos;t create a lot of opportunities with his passing ability. Sensabaugh can still be effective as a floor-spacing forward especially with ball-dominant guards also on the floor. 
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
        Defense: Work in Progress
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Sensabaugh&apos;s defensive profile in his second season is a mix of surprising strengths and clear areas for growth. He&apos;s actually been a bright spot in pick-and-roll coverage, ranking in the 93rd percentile against roll men and 79th percentile against ball handlers — a good sign that he can hold his ground in structured, two-man actions. But off the ball, there&apos;s still work to be done. He ranks near the bottom of the league when defending handoffs and off-screen movement — areas that demand timing, footwork, and sharp awareness. He&apos;s had trouble navigating screens and staying attached to cutters, which isn&apos;t all that uncommon for a young wing still adjusting to the speed and complexity of NBA defenses.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
        Final Verdict: A Valuable Offensive Weapon Hiding in Plain Sight
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Brice Sensabaugh isn&apos;t a household name yet — but his shooting metrics scream rotation-caliber offensive player.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Elite as a catch-and-shoot threat</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Efficient in transition and roll situations</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Improving in pull-up creation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Still developing on the defensively</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        In a league that craves shooting and versatility, Brice Sensabaugh might just be the hidden gem Utah&apos;s been quietly polishing.
